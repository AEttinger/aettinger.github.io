## Just image it!

Halfway through one of my first cell biology projects, this is what my supervisor at the time suggested. As I know now, when it comes to applying modern microscopy to cell biology questions, there rarely is a 'just'; to label cells, keep them alive for live-cell imaging, acquire meaningful data, and set up quantitative image analysis are all but trivial tasks (even though these days most brochures of microscope vendors may suggest so).

I started our this blog to share some things I learned about microscopy, microscope hardware and software, image processing and analysis over the years, and still continue to learn.
